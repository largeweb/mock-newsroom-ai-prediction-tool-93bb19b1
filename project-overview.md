# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Newsroom AI Prediction Tool

Description: A web application to *simulate* a helpful prediction tool for small to medium size newsrooms (10-100). The focus would be a helpful tool that generates dynamic paywalls and predicts when users will cancel subscriptions. All backend features for the AI will be mocked, with great frontend code.

Features:

*   Simulated Data Input: A way for the user to input information, or select to have random data generated.

*   Mock Subscription Predictions: The primary display will be frontend, with a display of what subscriptions will cancel, and why.

*   Mock Simple Paywall Tool: A display of what can be configured as a paywall, with what we think would be the best practices.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
